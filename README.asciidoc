== punkte

=== Backround info:

* I learned about using GIT-DIR and WORK-DIR for dotfiles from:
* https://stackoverflow.com/a/16811212/1698426
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25564555, the whole thread is about dotfiles
* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
* https://news.opensuse.org/2020/03/27/Manage-dotfiles-with-Git/
* on openwrt I needed to install git, git-http
* https://the.exa.website/docs/colour-themes[exa colours reference]


=== On a new installation, I usually want:

....
git clone https://github.com/marmalodak/home ~/.punkte
git -C $HOME/.punkte/.git --git-dir=$HOME/.punkte/.git --work-tree=$HOME checkout -- $HOME
# open a new shell, then:
punkt reset --hard  # when re-installing dotfiles into a messed up $HOME
# punkt pull --rebase --recurse-submodules --verbose --stat
punkt-auf
p10k configure
....

Before being able to push:

[code,shell]
=====
    [user]
        name = John Schmitt
        email = marmalodak@gmail.com
=====

==== Trouble

YTF is there a colon in the path to `zsh-edit`? The URL should be `url = https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-edit.git`, not `url = https://github.com:marlonrichert/zsh-edit.git`. How did that happen?

NB: submodules need to be absolute paths relative to $HOME

.submodule example
[code]
======
    [submodule ".vim/pack/vim8/start/vim-tmux-pilot"]
        path = .vim/pack/vim8/start/vim-tmux-pilot
        url = https://github.com/urbainvaes/vim-tmux-pilot
======

When `punkt-auf` fails because a submodule will not update because it wants to rebase (WHY???)

For example, `powerlevel10k`:
....
rm -rf .powerlevel10k
punkt-aufbau
punkt pull --rebase --recurse-submodules --verbose --stat
....

When `punkt-auf` fails because a submodule cannot be found in .gitmodules:
....
punkt rm --cached .vim/pack/vim8/start/vim-plugin-AnsiEsc
....

=== oh-my-zsh https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh[source]

`ohmyzsh` is a git submodule.

Open a new terminal to invoke the punkte (nÃ©e dotfiles)

== Brew

`brew bundle install Brewfile`
which was created from `brew bundle dump`

fonts require `svn`


=== rvm https://rvm.io/rvm/install[source]

[NOTE]
======
The RVM installer is beautiful bash code, going to read it and improve my shell game
======

[source]
----
rvm use ruby-2.7 --default
rvm install asciidoctor-diagram
----

[source]
----
brew install glib (for asciio)
brew install cairo (for asciio)
brew install gtk+ (for asciio)
brew install gtk+3 gtk4 gtkextra pango (for asciio)
----

Might be time to give up on drawing in asciidoctor or vim and use PlantUML, graphviz, pikchr

=== apg
`apg` is a great password generator.

* The powerline module gave me too much trouble, so Iâ€™m configuring that manually now, so I donâ€™t need the python virtual environment anymore
